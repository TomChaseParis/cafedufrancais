      text: " Pierre helped me enormously to improve my French through a combination of private and duo conversation classes. He was patient, kind and supportive and boosted my confidence as well as targeted specific areas in need of improvement. Enjoying a coffee in a Parisian cafe was the perfect way to immerse yourself in the culture and speak like a local! ",

      " Moving to Paris without a lick of French under my belt was daunting but Pierre immediately created a lesson plan tailored to me as well as a schedule plan that matched with my ever-changing work schedules. The duality of working on grammar, structure, vocabulary and sitting down to practice oral conversation is a very practical way of approaching a new language in a new country. I would definitely recommend him to potential students who are driven and committed to learning French. ",

I spent almost one year with him and improved my French significantly, from the scratch to an ability to speak freely with locals. The ambiance of the lessons was amazing, he helps students to feel comfortable and to get new levels step by step.",

I loved the combination of individual, pair and group lessons which had really enhanced my learning experience. There is no better way to learn French than sipping a cup of coffee in a relaxed environment. Merci !",

Added to its advantage was the flexibility to arrange your lessons as you go (for those who are often away from Paris), and to also tailor-make your courses according to your needs. Merci encore, c'Ã©tait super !",

I took other French courses in Paris with a language school, but  my French improved much more significantly after taking lessons with Pierre. Also, lessons were in lovely local cafes, for an authentic Parisian experience :).",
